# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

You probably spend hours from time to time scouring the web for cheap flights, great accommodations, go-to restaurants and must-see attractions – but how about being in the business of providing those things? Even if you only want to have an enjoyable vacation, it’s important to consider which airlines, hotels, and travel agencies have the most satisfied employees."
